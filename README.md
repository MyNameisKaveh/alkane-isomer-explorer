# Alkane Isomer Finder and Chemical Compound Explorer

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://andolinism-alkane-isomer-viewer.hf.space/)

**Live Demo: [https://andolinism-alkane-isomer-viewer.hf.space/](https://andolinism-alkane-isomer-viewer.hf.space/)**

## Overview

This web application, built with Python and Streamlit, serves as a versatile tool for exploring chemical compounds. It offers two main functionalities accessible through a user-friendly interface:

1.  **Alkane Isomer Search:** Allows users to input the name of an alkane (e.g., butane, pentane) and discover its structural isomers. For each isomer, the application displays:
    *   A 2D structural image.
    *   Its IUPAC name (or common name if IUPAC is not available).
    *   SMILES string.
    *   PubChem CID.
    *   An option to view its 3D structure.
    Additionally, physicochemical properties of the initially searched (main) alkane are presented.

2.  **General Molecule Information:** Enables users to search for any chemical compound by its name or other identifiers (like SMILES or CID). For the identified compound, the application provides:
    *   Detailed physicochemical properties.
    *   A 2D structural image.
    *   An interactive 3D structural view.

The 3D viewer allows users to select different representation styles (Stick, Line, Ball and Stick) and navigate between different isomers (in the alkane isomer search mode) using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. Users can also download the 2D structural images.

## Features

*   **Dual Search Modes:**
    *   Dedicated search for alkane isomers.
    *   General search for any chemical compound.
*   **Interactive Isomer Gallery:** Displays 2D structures of found alkane isomers in a configurable multi-column layout.
*   **Detailed Compound Properties:** Shows key physicochemical properties retrieved from PubChem for both the main searched alkane and any generally searched compound.
*   **Interactive 3D Molecular Viewer:**
    *   Utilizes `py3Dmol` for rendering 3D structures.
    *   Multiple display styles: Stick, Line, Ball and Stick.
    *   Navigation controls (Next, Previous, Clear) for browsing 3D structures of alkane isomers.
*   **2D Image Download:** Users can download the generated 2D structural images in PNG format.
*   **Example Searches:** Provides quick-access buttons for common alkane searches.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit, featuring a sidebar for search inputs and tabs for organized display of information.
*   **Responsive Layout:** Adapts to different screen sizes (Streamlit's default responsiveness, with a "centered" layout by default).

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The core programming language.
*   **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application UI.
*   **RDKit:** A cheminformatics toolkit used for:
    *   Parsing SMILES strings.
    *   Generating 2D coordinates for molecular drawing.
    *   Creating 2D molecular images.
    *   Basic molecular manipulations and property calculations (though primarily PubChemPy is used for fetching properties).
*   **PubChemPy:** A Python wrapper for the PubChem PUG REST API, used to:
    *   Search for compounds by name.
    *   Retrieve compound properties (molecular formula, weight, IUPAC name, SMILES, CID, etc.).
    *   Find isomers based on molecular formula.
    *   Download 3D SDF (Structure-Data File) data for molecular visualization.
*   **py3Dmol:** For embedding an interactive 3D molecular viewer in the web application.
*   **Pillow (PIL):** Used for handling image objects generated by RDKit.
*   **Hugging Face Spaces:** For deploying and hosting the web application.

## Application Structure

The application is organized into several logical components:

1.  **Helper Functions:**
    *   `draw_molecule_pil()`: Generates 2D PIL Image objects from SMILES strings.
    *   `image_to_bytes()`: Converts PIL Images to bytes for the download functionality.
    *   `get_sdf_content()`: Fetches 3D SDF data from PubChem using a CID.
    *   `generate_3d_viewer_html()`: Creates the HTML/JavaScript for the py3Dmol 3D viewer, allowing for different display styles.
    *   `get_compound_properties()`: Extracts and formats a predefined set of physicochemical properties from a PubChemPy `Compound` object.
    *   `process_alkane_request()`: Handles the logic for finding the main alkane, its properties, and its structural isomers.
    *   `process_general_molecule_search()`: Handles the logic for searching a general chemical compound and retrieving its information.

2.  **Streamlit UI:**
    *   **Page Configuration:** Sets the page title, layout (`centered`), and initial sidebar state.
    *   **Session State Management (`st.session_state`):** Crucial for maintaining the application's state across user interactions and reruns (e.g., storing search inputs, fetched data, selected items, UI states).
    *   **Sidebar (`st.sidebar`):** Contains:
        *   Two separate text input fields for "Alkane Isomer Search" and "General Molecule Information".
        *   Example buttons for quick alkane searches.
        *   "Search" buttons for each input type.
        *   A status message area to display feedback, search results, or errors.
    *   **Main Page Content (Tabs - `st.tabs`):**
        *   Dynamically created tabs based on the type of search performed and the availability of data.
        *   **For Alkane Isomer Search:**
            *   *Isomer Gallery Tab:* Displays 2D images of isomers with names, SMILES, CIDs, and download/3D view buttons. Also shows an expandable section for the main searched alkane's properties.
            *   *Alkane Properties Tab:* (Integrated into the Isomer Gallery tab via an expander in the final version).
            *   *Isomer 3D View Tab:* Shows the interactive 3D viewer for a selected isomer, with style selection and Next/Previous navigation.
        *   **For General Molecule Search:**
            *   *Properties Tab:* Displays detailed properties of the searched molecule.
            *   *2D Structure Tab:* Shows the 2D image of the molecule with a download button.
            *   *3D View Tab:* Shows the interactive 3D viewer for the molecule with style selection.
    *   **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Uses `st.spinner`, `st.info`, `st.error`, and `st.warning` to provide feedback to the user during operations.

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or save the `app_streamlit.py` file.**
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    pubchempy
    rdkit-pypi
    py3Dmol
    Pillow
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app_streamlit.py
    ```
    The application should openæ±¡æŸ“ç‰© in your default web browser.

## Future Enhancements (Possible Ideas)

*   More advanced filtering options for isomer search.
*   Direct SMILES input for searches.
*   Saving/Exporting search results or properties.
*   More customizable 3D view options (e.g., coloring schemes, labels).
*   Integration of other chemical databases or property prediction tools.
*   User accounts for saving preferences or search history.
